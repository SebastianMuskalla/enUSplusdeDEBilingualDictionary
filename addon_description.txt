This is a bilingual dictionary for enUS (American English) and deDE (German Standard German).

This dictionary is meant for users who regularly write in German and English.
If you load this dictionary, you will <strong>not need to manually switch between dictionaries for the two languages</strong>.

As a downside, sentences that are half-German and half-English, but correct in neither language will erroneously be seen as correct by the spellchecker,
e.g. "Ich like dieses dictionary."
In other words, this dictionary will <strong>not warn you when you mix the two languages</strong>.

<strong>Note:</strong> This dictionary registers as a dictionary for American English.
Hence, after installing it, you will need to set your spellchecking to American English for it to work.
