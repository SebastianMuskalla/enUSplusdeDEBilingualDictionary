enUS (American English) plus deDE (German Standard German) bilingual dictionary
===============================================================================

### This is a Hunspell dictionary that supports both enUS (American English) and deDE (German Standard German).

Hunspell <https://hunspell.github.io/> is a spellchecking library used by LibreOffice, Mozilla Firefox, Thunderbird, and many other projects.
This dictionary for Hunspell simply combines dictionaries for German Standard German and American English.

### Why?

This dictionary is meant for users who regularly write in German and English.
If you load this dictionary, you will **not need to manually switch** between dictionaries for the two languages.

### Downside

With this dictionary, sentences that are half-German and half-English, but correct in neither language will erroneously be seen as correct by the spellchecker,
e.g. "Ich like dieses dictionary."
In other words, this dictionary will not warn you when you mix the two languages.

How has this been created?
--------------------------

This bilingual dictionary has been created based on the "igerman98" dictionary for German Standard German and the en_US Hunspell Dictionary for American English.

Both dictionaries were converted to UTF8.
Then, the enUS dictionary was reorganized so that its set of affixes (i.e. the letters used to refer to the rules in the `.aff` file) are disjoint from the set of affixes used by the deDE dictionary.
Finally, the two dictionaries were merged.
